Code exp.:

let ilyaItems = ['Eye of Skadi', 'BKB', 'Boots of travel', 'Daedalus', 'MKB', 'Manta Style'];
let ilyaDrunk = true;

function destroyItems() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        console.log(${ilyaItems[ilyaItems.length - 1]} destroyed!);
        ilyaItems.pop();
        if (ilyaItems.length === 0) {
            console.log('I'm AFK, let them finish');
        }
    }
}

if (ilyaDrunk) {
    destroyItems();
} else {
    alert('I hate this game!');
}
